- Graph Isomorphism

[Graph isomorphism - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_isomorphism)

## Approach üìù

First assign each node label 1, then for each node $v$ at step $i$ we assign it a new color based on the multiset of neighbors colors as stated in equation 1. we keep repeating this process $k$ times. at last each node in the graph has encoded its own structural informations.

**we run this algorithm for any two given graphs (with same number of nodes and edges), at final step we compare the coloring for these graphs if they are similar then the two graphs are isomorphic**

### Equations

$$
C_{i,v} = Hash(C_{i-1, v}, \{C_{i-1, u}; u \in \mathcal{N}(v)\})
